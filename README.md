# Palindrome5Digits

This program presents three distinct algorithms that ultimately compute the sum of all possible 5-digit palindromes.
(Palindrome: a sequence of letters, characters or numbers that reads the same backwards as forwards)

Each subsequent algorithm is more efficient at calulating this sum than the previous.
